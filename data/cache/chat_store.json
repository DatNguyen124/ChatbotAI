Here's a simplified breakdown of how to make a basic beef pho (pho bo):\n\n### Ingredients:\n- **For the broth:**\n  - 2-3 pounds beef bones (preferably marrow bones and knuckle bones)\n  - 1 onion, halved\n  - 1 piece of ginger (about 3 inches), halved\n  - 5-6 star anise\n  - 1-2 cinnamon sticks\n  - 4-5 cloves\n  - 1 tablespoon coriander seeds\n  - Fish sauce (to taste)\n  - Salt (to taste)\n  - Water (about 4-5 quarts)\n\n- **For the soup:**\n  - Rice noodles (b\u00e1nh ph\u1edf)\n  - Thinly sliced beef (such as sirloin or brisket)\n  - Fresh herbs (basil, cilantro, mint)\n  - Bean sprouts\n  - Lime wedges\n  - Sliced jalape\u00f1os or chili peppers\n  - Hoisin sauce and sriracha (for serving)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Broth:**\n   - **Roast the Bones:** Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Place the beef bones on a baking sheet and roast for about 30-45 minutes until browned. This step adds depth to the flavor.\n   - **Char the Onion and Ginger:** While the bones are roasting, char the onion and ginger directly over an open flame or under the broiler until they are slightly blackened. This enhances the flavor of the broth.\n   \n2. **Simmer the Broth:**\n   - In a large pot, add the roasted bones, charred onion, ginger, and spices (star anise, cinnamon, cloves, coriander seeds). Cover with water and bring to a boil.\n   - Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for at least 4-6 hours (the longer, the better). Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface.\n   - After simmering, strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve to remove solids. Return the clear broth to the pot and season with fish sauce and salt to taste.\n\n3. **Prepare the Noodles:**\n   - Cook the rice noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process.\n\n4. **Assemble the Pho:**\n   - In a bowl, place a portion of the cooked rice noodles. Top with raw sliced beef (the hot broth will cook it), and ladle the hot broth over the top.\n   - Serve with fresh herbs, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and sliced jalape\u00f1os on the side. Allow everyone to customize their bowls with hoisin sauce and sriracha.\n\n### Tips:\n- **Flavor Adjustments:** If you prefer a richer broth, you can add more bones or simmer longer. Adjust the fish sauce for saltiness and depth.\n- **Ingredient Substitutions:** If you can't find certain spices, you can use a pre-made pho spice mix available in stores.\n- **Vegetarian Option:** For a vegetarian version, use vegetable broth and mushrooms for umami flavor, and omit the meat.\n\nEnjoy your homemade pho!", "additional_kwargs": {}}, {"role": "user", "content": "how to cook pho", "additional_kwargs": {}}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cooking pho, a traditional Vietnamese noodle soup, involves several steps, but it's a rewarding process.
